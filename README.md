# Takeout-Food-Chain-Landing-Page-Design
A mini project for a UI/UX Workshop hosted by NUST Cyber Security Club | Goal was to create a landing page design for any brand. The theme I went for was a fictional brand "Take-A-Ways" which aimed towards providing healthy meals in a contact-free way due to COVID. I went for sage green as the main colour to symbolize health.
